albums.html
In this file the javascript part renders the content and submit ajax call to the server.
display: function() : is just for displaying uploaded data in table.
render: function(): is for displaying filedata to the dialog box.

views.py
The uploaded file is sent to the view.py/create() method.
Here according to the "action" type, can do create, update, and delete document.
content_type is for the file types what you are inserting.

serializer.py
save() methods leads control to the serializer.py/create() method.
Here the actual model operation is done.
3 models are related with each other. And the root model operation will effect to the other models.


Thanks.
